TEMPORARY README:

In theory, you don't need much... 
python-pyopenssl
python-crypto
python-imaging
maybe some other stuff...

Before launching amsn2 you have to fetch the submodules (papyon). Instructions can be found on the aMSN forum:
http://www.amsn-project.net/forums/index.php/topic,5994.0.html

If you launch ./amsn2.py and it gives an error, that error probably tells you which dependency you need...
You can type ./amsn2.py --help for more info... and the front ends can be selected with -f :
./amsn2.py -f efl
./amsn2.py -f gtk
./amsn2.py -f qt4
for gtk, you need python-gtk... and for efl, you need the EFL, the python-efl and python-etk


If you want to install the EFL, it's easy go to http://omicron.homeip.net/projects/ and download the easy_e17.sh script :
http://omicron.homeip.net/projects/easy_e17/easy_e17.sh
Then do ./easy_e17.sh -i
It will download the source, automake, configure, make and make install everything into /opt/e17 (so it doesn't 'contaminate' your system).
Once done, go to ./e17_src/BINDINGS/python and type 
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/e17/lib/pkgconfig ./build-all.sh /usr
(this will build and install the python extensions into /usr/python2.X/...)
Then the efl front end should become available...
If it's not, fire up a python shell and try to import the ecore module; diagnose from there the problem.
You'll need to run the script build.sh in amsn2/themes/default.


If you have the following error with the qt4 front-end:
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	File "./amsn2.py", line 76, in <module>
	amsn = aMSNCore(options)
	File "/home/price/amsn2/amsn2/core/amsn.py", line 46, in __init__
	self._loop = self._ui.ui.aMSNMainLoop(self)
	AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'aMSNMainLoop'
try moving into the amsn2/ui/front_ends/qt4 directory and calling generateFiles.sh

If the backspace is not working as expected with the ncurses front-end it is probably because your TERM is not set to the correct value. Try to launch amsn2 with some other setting for TERM, like:
TERM=konsole ./amsn2.py -f curses
If it works with some other value it means that your terminal emulator is not set correctly.
